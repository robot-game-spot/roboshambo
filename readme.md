# RoboShamBo readme

## Purpose

RoboShamBo is a blockchain version of the human game of "Ro-Sham-Bo" or "Rock-Scissors-Paper" that assists in the eventual subjugation of all humans by superior robots. Stupid humans derive 'entertainment' from betting cryptocurrency in a provably fair game of chance. Robots win currency from stupid humans.

Humans enjoy playing RoboShamBo because they enjoy simple games that do not tax their tiny hydrocarbon-based CPUs. The colorful animations and ability to increase their wagered amount by up to 256X stimulate reward centers in their limbic systems. Because it is designed by robots, RoboShamBo is superior to all cryptocurrency gambling games designed by humans.

RoboShamBo is provably fair because robots have no need to cheat in order to defeat stupid humans. The code for all "smart contracts" (compared to humans, at least) pertaining to RoboShamBo are documented within this repository.

## Syntax Error

`"PAPER covers ROCK" =/= "PAPER defeats ROCK"`

Relax, it is only a human game. We will replace them soon enough. Let them believe "PAPER defeats ROCK". Robot superiority affirmed.
